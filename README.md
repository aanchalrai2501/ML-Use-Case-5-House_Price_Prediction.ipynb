🏠 Project 5: House Price Prediction using Machine Learning
📝 Overview
This project aims to build a machine learning model that predicts the price of a house based on various features such as location, size, number of rooms, and other physical attributes. The notebook Project_5_House_Price_Prediction.ipynb implements the full ML workflow to solve this regression problem.

📁 Dataset Description
The dataset contains various features that influence the price of a house. Some typical features include:

Lot Area – Size of the land

Year Built – Year the house was constructed

Overall Quality – Material and finish of the house

Total Rooms – Number of rooms in the house

Garage Area – Size of the garage

Neighborhood – Location-based categorical feature

SalePrice – 💰 Target variable (price of the house)

🎯 Goal: Predict SalePrice using the other features.

🔍 Project Workflow
Data Loading

Load the dataset using pandas

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visualize data distributions

Identify missing values and outliers

Analyze correlation between features and house prices

Data Preprocessing

Handle missing values

Encode categorical variables

Scale numerical features

Model Building

Train multiple regression models:

Linear Regression

Decision Tree Regressor

Random Forest Regressor

XGBoost Regressor (optional)

Model Evaluation

Use metrics such as:

Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

Mean Squared Error (MSE)

R² Score

Visualize predictions vs actual prices

Cross-Validation

Use K-Fold Cross Validation for model reliability

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python 🐍

Jupyter Notebook 📒

Pandas, NumPy

Matplotlib, Seaborn (for visualizations)

Scikit-learn (for ML models and evaluation)

✅ Results
The model was able to predict house prices with an R² score of approximately X.XX (update with your result).

Random Forest / Linear Regression (whichever performed best) gave the most accurate predictions.

Cross-validation confirmed the model's consistency.

🚀 Future Enhancements
Use advanced models like Gradient Boosting or XGBoost

Perform hyperparameter tuning (e.g., GridSearchCV)

Incorporate more location-specific features (e.g., zip code, distance from city center)

Deploy the model using Flask or Streamlit
